## Execution Instructions

This plan is designed for execution by `/implement --planned`:

1. **Stage 1 (Discover)**: Haiku will verify file locations
2. **Stage 2 (Plan)**: SKIPPED - using this plan
3. **Stage 3 (Write)**: Sonnet executes steps exactly as written
4. **Stage 4 (Verify)**: Sonnet runs tests and checks
5. **Stage 5 (Fix)**: Opus fixes issues if any found

### Critical: Do Not Deviate

- Follow steps in order
- Use exact file paths specified
- Implement patterns as referenced
- Write tests as specified

---

## Plan Validation Checklist

Before execution, verify:

- [ ] All file paths are valid
- [ ] All referenced patterns exist
- [ ] Step instructions are explicit (not vague)
- [ ] Type definitions are complete
- [ ] Test cases are specific
